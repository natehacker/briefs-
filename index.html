                    guides (MMGs), several dates are important both as individual core surveillance data elements as well as contributing to components of other, hierarchical data elements used for case counting and CDC reporting. Due to the importance
                    of these dates, four dates/date concepts were selected as the first set of data elements for the DSWG to assess: illness onset date, report dates, laboratory-related dates, and diagnosis date. Standardizing the use of these dates across
                    programs and jurisdictions has the additional benefit of establishing a common vocabulary when dealing with complex or hierarchical data elements in the future. Each data element included in this brief includes three areas:</td>
